Start with Tokenization:

Focus on breaking the input into tokens.

Test your lexer with various inputs (e.g., commands with quotes, redirections, pipes).

Move to Syntax Checking:

Once tokenization works, implement syntax checking.

Test with valid and invalid inputs to ensure your checker catches errors.

Build the Parse Tree:

Finally, implement the parse tree construction.

Test with complex commands to ensure the tree is built correctly.

Why This Order Works
Incremental Development: You build and test each component step by step.

Easier Debugging: If something goes wrong, youâ€™ll know which component to fix.

Clear Separation of Concerns: Each part of the parser has a specific responsibility.

Next Steps
Write a lexer to tokenize the input.

Test it with various inputs (e.g., ls -la, echo "hello" > file.txt).

Once tokenization works, move on to syntax checking.
